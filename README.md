# WEBSITE SERVER STATUS : Down
Due to an unexpected load on our front-end servers this morning, our website is __down 14 Feb 2020__. We aim to recover the site later today.

You will likely have problems __pairing new users__ today, but you should __still be able to transfer photos__. However, you can install this 1.7.6 patch on your server to resolve the pairing issue (note: this is a recommended step, regardless):

## Frequently Asked Questions

* Where do the photos appear?
If you use the default settings a folder will be created on your desktop, and the photos will go there once transferred. However, this is configurable (and if a Medical package is detected e.g. MedTech, it will default to it’s media folder)
 
* How do I re-open the server?
You will find ‘MedImage Server’ on your desktop, and on your start bar under ‘programs’, depending on which version of Windows you are using. If you cannot find this, you can also enter ‘localhost:5566’ into your browser URL bar.

* Do I need any technical knowledge?
You do not need technical knowledge. You should have a Windows PC (e.g. Vista, 7, 10, Server). You should also have ‘Administrator’ access, so that you can install the server. If not, you will likely need to get in touch with your system admin.
 
* What sort of phone can I use?
Almost any Android phone or tablet, and almost any iPhone or iPad.
 
## Using MedImage

This video demonstrates transferring an image from your phone to your PC. Enter the name or ID of your patient before taking the photo. You can enter a '#' before the name of the image to specify a folder on the PC. The images are ready for use: e.g 'Peter-19-Oct-2016-12-04-56.jpg', would mean the photo of Peter was taken on the 19th October shortly after 12 midday.
