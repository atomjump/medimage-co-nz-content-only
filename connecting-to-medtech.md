# Connecting to MedTech

MedTech is a common medical system found within New Zealand practices, but also in other countries around the world. There are several different MedTech products.

## MedTech32

To connect to MedTech32 you have two options:

1. Send the photos to the attachments folder, and manually add the photos to the patient record from within MedTech32. This option uses the free MedImage Server software, which will automatically set the correct target folder to C:\mt32\attachments during installation.
2. Purchase the MedTech32 MedImage Add-on software which will add each new photo directly into the MedTech32 database system, becoming visible from within the Attachments window of the patient record within a few seconds. There is a one-time license fee per installation of Medtech32, which costs US$480.
More details for this Add-on are here: 

## MedTech Evolution

While it is planned to have a MedTech Evolution MedImage add-on in future, currently you should use the free MedImage Server software as-is.
