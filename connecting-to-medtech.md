# Connecting to MedTech

MedTech is a common medical system found within New Zealand practices, but also in other countries around the world. There are several different MedTech products.

## MedTech32

To connect to MedTech32 you have two options:

1. Send the photos to the attachments folder, and manually add the photos to the patient record from within MedTech32. This option uses the free MedImage Server software, which will automatically set the correct target folder to C:\mt32\attachments during installation.
2. Purchase the EHR Connector MedImage Add-on software which, along with the EHR MedTech32 addition, will add each new photo directly into the MedTech32 database system, becoming visible from within the Attachments window of the patient record within a few seconds. There is a one-time license fee per installation of the EHR Connector, which costs US$480. Note: the photo link will only be clickable within the Attachments window, but a note on the Patient Manager 'Daily Record' section will also appear.

More details for this Add-on are here:

__Note__: Our MedImage Server software does not affect a MedTech database in any way, but you can choose to send photos into the MedTech attachment folder. The add-on software does insert records into your MedTech database. The current official approval status by MedTech is detailed on this page:

## Installation Assistance

While our EHR Connector software can be installed by a competent MedTech engineer who is following our documentation, there are situations when it is best if MedImage handle the installation. We offer this installation service at an additional cost of US$265, payable once the customer is happy that the installation works and does what they expect it to.
