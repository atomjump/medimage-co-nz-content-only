# Building an Alternative Client to MedImage

	

While the MedImage App is a useful tool, it is certainly not all-comprehensive, and since the MedImage Server is an open platform we encourage other developers to send files from their own apps into the MedImage Server. This provides developers with a tried and tested route for their photos (or other files) to be sent to an increasingly wide range of back-end medical systems.

 
## Pairing Process

1. The user clicks the pairing button on the MedImage Server. This does a request for a new code generated by a script that we host at atomjump.com.
2. A 4 letter pairing code (which is usable for an hour) is shown visually on the Server.
3. On your own app, the user specifies that they are connecting to a new server, and an input box appears asking for the 4 letter code.
4. Your app quizzes the hosted database at atomjump.com with that 4 letter code, and a URL is returned which uniquely (i.e. globally uniquely) corresponds with the MedImage server’s address.
5. The app stores this URL in it’s memory, and it will continue to send photos there, so no further pairing is required.



## API Calls

From your app you can call the pairing script

```
https://atomjump.com/med-genid.php?compare=[user's 4 letter code from MedImage Server]
```

Which will return a MedImage Server URL on a successful code e.g.

```
https://medimage-nz1.atomjump.com/write/uPSE4UWHmJ8XqFUqvf
```

Or on a failure:

```
nomatch
```

This should then have a multi-part https POST request done with the image or file attached, sent to the URL:

```
https://medimage-nz1.atomjump.com/write/uPSE4UWHmJ8XqFUqvf/api/photo
```

(note the /api/photo appended, which always needs to be added)

* The filename string entered into the POST request should have any spaces replaced with hyphens ‘-‘.
* A hash in front of any word from the original file-name string signifies a new folder on the server.

```
Filename String                 Created in the Server target folder
